# Bank-Loans-Analysis
I embarked in this project as I found a liking in the finance sector.
This project used two technologies (SQL & Power Bi).
The sql part was necessary as it helped calculate and analyze the large dataset that was present. Power Bi was a key technology as it helped create an interactive dashboard to visualise my results from the analysis. The two technologies were useful in comparison of the results and making sure the information produced is accurate. 
Analysing large datasets is a bit tedious and considering it is providing necessary information for decision making in a Bank that offers its services to many countries it requires knowledge in finance.
