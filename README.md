# Bank-Loans-Analysis
Intrigued by the potential insights hidden within sales data, I embarked on this project to analyze bank loan performance. By leveraging Power BI and SQL Server, I aimed to uncover trends, patterns, and key performance indicators that could inform strategic decision-making.

## Data
The dataset encompasses comprehensive information on bank loans, including loan amount, interest rate, loan term, customer demographics, and repayment status.

## Tools

Power BI: For data modeling, visualization, and interactive report creation.
SQL Server: For data storage and retrieval.

## Methodology

Data Acquisition: Relevant loan data was extracted from the SQL Server database.
Data Cleaning and Transformation: Data inconsistencies were addressed, and necessary transformations were applied to ensure data accuracy and reliability.
Data Modeling: A robust data model was created in Power BI to establish relationships between different data elements.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Initial exploration was conducted to understand data distribution and identify potential patterns.
Visualization: Interactive dashboards were developed using Power BI to present key findings and insights.

## Visualizations

The project includes three interactive dashboards that provide a comprehensive overview of the bank loan portfolio:
